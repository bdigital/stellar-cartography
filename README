== Stellar Cartography

This is a lib for normalizing and parsing US street addresses.

It may have unexpected behavior, and was built specifically for parsing malformed addresses.

Alpha grade.  Also not optimized at all. And really, no reason to use it over a geocoding API.  So here it is, useful or not.

== Usage

StellarCartography.parse_address '100 fake st., Portland, OR 97205'
=> {:address=>"100 fake st", :city=>"portland", :state=>"OR", :zipcode=>"97205"}
